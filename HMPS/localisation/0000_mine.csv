first_combat_subs_desc;The submarine became a potentially viable weapon with the development of the Whitehead torpedo, designed in 1866 by British engineer Robert Whitehead, the first practical self-propelled or 'locomotive' torpedo. The spar torpedo that had been developed earlier by the Confederate States Navy was considered to be impracticable, as it was believed to have sunk both its intended target, and probably H. L. Hunley, the submarine that deployed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2nd_combat_subs_desc;The first time military submarines had significant impact on a war was in World War I. Forces such as the U-boats of Germany operated against Allied commerce (Handelskrieg); the submarine's ability to function as a practical war machine relied on new tactics, their numbers, and submarine technologies such as combination diesel/electric power system that had been developed in the preceding years.;;;;;;;;;;;;

interwar_carriers_desc;As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

If we are to remain what we always have been, and not become something else entirely, now is the time to assume control of our own destiny.

mechanical_cotton;Mechanical Cotton Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mechanical_cotton_desc;Egypt under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principal energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. It was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to the Egyptian cotton industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

bronze_factory;Bronze Factory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bronze_factory_desc;Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 1212.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals (such as aluminium, manganese, nickel or zinc) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic, phosphorus or silicon. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as strength, ductility, or machinability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

industrial_bronze_production;Industrial Bronze;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_bronze_production_desc;Bronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period. Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of stainless steel owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_boots_production;Mass Shoe Production;;;;;;;;;;;;;
industrial_boots_production_desc;Until the 19th century, shoemaking was a traditional handicraft, but by the century's end, the process had been almost completely mechanized, with production occurring in large factories. Despite the obvious economic gains of mass-production, the factory system produced shoes without the individual differentiation that the traditional shoemaker was able to provide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
interwar_hulls;Interwar Hull Construction;;;;;;;;;;;;;
interwar_hulls_desc;During World War One, many ships sank, so after the war there were a few years when there was high demand for building new ships.

This was partly a result of the peace terms, under which Germany was expected to build ships to be distributed among the Allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC7777930;The California Gold Rush (18481855) was a gold rush that began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and the sudden population increase allowed California to go rapidly to statehood, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation and the California genocide.
