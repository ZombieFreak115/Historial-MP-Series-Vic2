# Vic2 Rules Preface
 
There are 2 sets of rules for the campaign, the in-game (session) rules and out-of-game (campaign) rules.
The 1st set deals with rules to prevent abuse of game mechanics and make a more fair and enjoyable experience, and the 2nd set is more meta and about attendance, behaviour, tag switching etc.
Nurse Reno's Rules heavily inspired this write up of my own, link: https://pastebin.com/AvPHMSNZ
<br/>

Limited rationale will be given at the end of each ruleset for some of the rules given (to explain / clarify why they exist), and it will be stated here and on both rulesets that the exact wording of the rule is second to the GM (game master) and their interpretation of the rule. The GM will always have the final say.
