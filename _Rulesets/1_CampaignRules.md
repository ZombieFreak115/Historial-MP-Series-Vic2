### 0. Preface
This ruleset is for the organisation and running of the campaign and does not concern in-game mechanics.
I do not expect this ruleset to need regular enforcement, but it is here to set out what is expected of players when taking part in a campaign (and if needing to throw the book at someone).
As always the GM's interpretation of the rules and their spirit is more important than the exact wording of the rules themselves.
<br/>

#### 1. Reservations
	A) Nations are reserved for the 1st session only, if you dont show it is no longer your nation
	B) 1st session substitution is allowed, with prior warning given to the GM
	C) GM can prioritize regulars and players who have been vouched for by regulars on GPs (and pseudo GPs)
	D) Can pick 'hostile' puppets in spite of overlord's desires (i.e Wallachia / Egypt)
	E) India & China (and forming either) is restricted, and allowed solely at GM discretion

#### 2. Rehosts & Speed
	A) Rehosting will be done on the half hour - exception for OOS player wars
	B) The lobby will not wait
	C) The GM will call rehosts. Do not leave the lobby before they do
	D) Be able to maintain 2 speed, you will be kicked otherwise
	E) The host should lower the speed to at max 2 for a player war

#### 3. Non-Attendance
	A) Your nation is protected for a session if you cant make it and it is ai (cannot be used consecutively)
	B) A protected nation can still have land (with GM approval) taken from it to allow other players to progress
	C) Any player substituted nation is not classed as protected

#### 4. Repicking
	A) Can repick a nation with GM approval (guideline is if current pick is ruined, irrelevant, or no longer exists)
	B) Any repicks that mess with a player are banned

#### 5. Ragequit & Toxicity
	A) Ragequiters will be banned from playing key picks
	B) Metagrudging between campaigns is prohibited
	C) Any player deemed toxic by the lobby will be warned once, 2nd time banned
	D) Defence clause: If you feel like the GM is intentionally ruling against you for reasons other than fairness, you have the right to ragequit the game without any penalty.

#### 6. Rule Change mid-campaign
	A) Only taken when really necessary, and the GM is advised to consult the lobby on this
	B) Should be done when the campaign health is at risk if not

### 7. Rationale
- China is limited due to the shear power its pops and the union tag have. India (in HMPS) for the same reasons.
- Permitting limited land to still be taken allows nations to still form their map, i.e Germany to take AL and no more.
- Anti-Metagrudge rule to prohibit out of campaign politics (i.e from a previous one or elsewhere) adversely affecting the current campaign.
- Sometimes rules need to change mid campaign due to an unforeseen circumstance, it happens.
