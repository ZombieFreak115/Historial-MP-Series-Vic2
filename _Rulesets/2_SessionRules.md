### 0. Preface
This ruleset deals with in-game mechanics, and how players should act with them. These are built from the Reno Rules: https://pastebin.com/AvPHMSNZ. As always the GM's interpretation of the rules and their spirit is more important than the exact wording of the rules themselves.

### 1. Alliances
	A) Joining a conflict REQUIRES that you have the intent to participate in that conflict.
	B) Vision alliances are allowed - announce them in chat.

### 2. CBs & War Declaration
	A) All Player wars, including transfer wars, MUST be announced with a pause and a statement of wargoals. (These initial wargoals MUST BE TAKEN in the peace of that war, unless a negotiated peace)
	B) You must give a reasonable amount (GM decision) of time based on how devastated a loser was to declare a chain (war immediately after another) war.
		i) Chain war guidance: reaching 100 we would give the full 5 year 'truce' protection, likewise for having whole army wiped
		ii) Event wars are excluded.
		iii) Exception: Declaring to take cores (cannot escalate this war to include any other war goal)
	C) Attacking spherelings of a player allow that player to join and escalate the conflict into a player-war without stating intent to join.
		i) Adding CBs on a sphereling whilst fighting the overlord will count towards total warscore.
		ii) Can separately declare on a player's sphereling with mil access cb / humiliate if already fighting that player. Does not count toward total warscore & cannot add any additional CBs on that sphereling.
	D) For the first year of the war, only declared wargoals may be added by the attacker. Defenders are limited to 20% above what the attackers declared for up to 101% warscore. After one year, wars "escalate" and you may add what you want up to 101% warscore if it is not already.
		i) In the event that a player war becomes a great war, none of this at all matters and you can immediately add up to 101% warscore in tickers whenever you want.
	E) Wars that are fought / coordinated 'together' (at GM discretion) are considered merged wars, with all the same rules applying to the combined wars. Read Rule J in Peace Offers & Separate Peace.
		i) Warscore allocation is controlled by the war leader / GPs of the initial war. 
	F) Adding multiple CBs on the same target or general target to double dip tickers is NOT allowed. (Example: Release two sicilies + take state sicily + etc)
		i) Also applies to reparations or cut-downs on the same target.
	G) Do not use transfer war land swaps to gain research points.
	H) Infamy slaving will be curbed at GM discretion.
		i) Guidance: war participation, beneficial agreements, intent to hold land, ai or player

### 3. Intervention and Ongoing Wars:
	A) If a player wishes to join a player war (i.e a war they did not initiate or are the target of), they must give intent to join:
		i) Within 7 days of declaration - Can join immediately on announcement
		ii) Post 7 days of declaration - Must wait 1 month post announcement
		iii) Cannot join post a surrender (if post 7 days)
	B) Interventions via friendly influence into an ongoing player - ai war require a 1 month announcement.
	C) Once declared intent to join, the nation must join the war within 3 months or they lose the right to join that war.
		i) A truced nation who wrongly announces early to join is not prevented from joining, but if attacked during the early announce period the war will not be merged.
	D) No player may join a war with the intention of surrendering immediately or hijacking the war (becoming war leader) and then surrendering the war or white peacing specific nations from the war to undermine CBs that were added on them.
	E) Players may request for the enemy to call their puppet(s) into the war.

### 4. Rules of Engagement
	A) Combat units are NOT allowed to retreat more than one province from battles. (Unless behind closed lines where the enemy cant reach in time.)
	B) Combat units are NOT allowed to retreat through enemy units. Rule breaking units must be deleted.
	C) Combat units are NOT allowed to retreat through enemy frontlines. Rule breaking units must be deleted.
	D) Combat units are NOT allowed to move from neutral territory into enemy territory or vice versa during player wars.
	E) Combat units are NOT allowed to move from neutral territory directly into a battle.
	F) Combat units are NOT allowed to retreat to neutral territory.
	G) Combat units are NOT allowed to initiate battles in neutral territory. (Exception is units trapped from a truce break.)
	H) Troops leftover in enemy territories or neutral territories must always return to allied lands as soon as possible unless they have military access.
	I) You are NOT allowed to delete units about to be attacked or are on the frontlines (less than 3 provinces away from enemy units if an open front) to avoid getting those stacks wiped and/or losing battle warscore.
	J) Do not hide ships in neutral ports.
	K) Do not join a war when your troops are in the same province as an enemy participant.
	L) Do not move into a province where the enemy is battling rebels.
The general rule of thumb for this is you can go neutral to friendly, friendly to neutral, neutral to neutral. You can NEVER go neutral to enemy or enemy to neutral. Territories you/war allies have occupied are considered friendly. Do NOT retreat encircled units to neutral territory. \
**Rule breaking units must be deleted**

### 5. Peace Offers and Separate Peace
	A) Do NOT spam peace offers with the intent to grief.
	B) Do NOT hold onto a past peace offer. (aka holding the peace in the corner)
	C) Do NOT stab hit peace offers.
	D) No peace offer can exceed 101% warscore.
	E) If the GPs of the victorious alliance cannot agree on enforcing a CB, then that CB is void from the peace.
	F) The CBs initiating a player war must be apart of the peace (in the case of a formal surrender)
	G) Surrenders must be stated in chat with a pause and CANNOT be retracted. Ask for terms if you wish to negotiate.
	H) A war leader may NOT surrender the entire war unless all GPs on their side have consented to peace.
	I) If an enemy separate peace surrenders the war, then you may add up to 20% higher warscore on them outside of the overall 101% limit.
	J) A surrender (ai or player) by a non-war leader means the victorious alliance MUST send a peace offer, a part of the overall 101% maximum, as soon as possible. (aside from the allowed extra 20% for separate peacing)
	K) Should a side achieve 100% warscore from battles/occupations/blockades/etc then their wargoals up to their maximum 101% must be accepted by the losing side so long as they follow the earlier rules.
		i) You MUST first take tickers that contributed to the force peace
		ii) Merged wars can be force-peaced if the total reaches 100. Warscore from battles is capped at the max of a single war.
	L) Nations that wish to separate peace but are an important avenue for invasion, or troop movement, will become either a DMZ or neutral-territory to the CB-enforcing side at the CB-enforcing's side discretion (must be given mil access).
		i) If neutral is chosen, the enemies of the CB-enforcing side cannot have troops in this land.
		ii) A DMZ has no neutral access restrictions.
	M) Declaring a war with a low cost CB to preemptively block a larger CB aimed at you (must be building or built) is prohibited.
	N) Cannot surrender away land occupied by a different enemy (or if surrendered).
		i) This INCLUDES transfer CBs.
		ii) Players separately fighting ai must adhere to this on the defender's behalf when peacing the ai.
	O) The victorious side must offer the peace within 1 year of the surrender being announced (if permitted to add war goals).

### 6. Stalemate Rules
	A) Stalemate will be called if no serious geostrategic offensives are made after a year during any sort of player conflicts (intervention, great war, normal war, etc).
	B) Once a stalemate call has been made, both sides have 3 months to start a serious military offensive to reset the timer / discontinue the timer.
	C) Sacrificing token units to keep a war going will not be allowed.
	D) Once a stalemate has officially caused a war to end, the winning side will be the side with the most FULLY occupied regions will technically win and they may only add those fully occupied regions as CBs. No non-land CBs are allowed except great war capitulation if it is a great war.

### 7. Economic Rules
	A) You cannot willingly go bankrupt.
	B) No deleting factories in a state you are about to lose to the enemy in a peace offer.
	C) Cannot sphere any China-restricted states.
	D) Cannot take any China-restricted as an unciv.

### 8. Releasing Nations and Nation Ruining
	A) You may only release a nation if it is not nation ruining.
	B) Do not release to reintegrate later via an event.
	C) Excessive transfer of infamy at your expense will be considered nation ruining (GM can judge 'excessive' on whether they think the gains of the infamy increase were proportionate to their cost). Be warned, I will save edit any abuse with this.
	D) Any player nation willingly inherited (or made unplayable) by another player must be below 10 infamy and inheritor below 15.

### 9. Host Nation Rules
	A) You must at ALL TIMES be allied to the GM/host nation (if they are a non-participant), and if that alliance breaks for whatever reason (war declarations between players usually does this) you must immediately refresh or accept an alliance from the host nation.
	B) You cannot build a CB of ANY kind on the host nation (if it is a non-participant) or declare a war of any kind on the host nation. Doing so will get you f*cking smacked.

### 10. China Restrictions (optional - campaign dependent)
	A) Directly owning China (China-restricted states) is off limits unless there is a Chinese player, with the exception of:
		i) Manchuria
		ii) Formosa
		iii) Hainan
		iv) Mongolia
		v) Tibet
		vi) Xinjiang
		vii) and any treaty port
	B) If there is a Chinese player, you are NOT allowed to sphere them.
<br/>

## 11. Rationale
- The broad reasoning for a lot of these rules is to discourage 100% wars every time, and to prevent player nations constantly getting ruined on with no chance of recovery.
- Uncivs have higher infamy transfer to allow them to expand a bit more rapidly, it is NOT intended to be an infamy sink for civs. If this is abused I will change the mod / tighten the rules on it.
- Stalemate rules were moved into their own section due to their importance.
- The optional restrictions on eating directly into China are there to prevent unbalanced global RGO outputs, and large manpower pools that would distort the 'historical' nature of the mod. Judge their need at the start of every campaign on a case by case basis.

**These rules will always be subject to change if necessary.**
